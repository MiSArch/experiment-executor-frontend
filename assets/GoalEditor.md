# üéØ Experiment Goals Configuration

The **Goal Configuration** allows you to define **measurable goals** in terms of user metrics such as latency for your experiments.  
The configuration can be either done **manually** or automatically using an automated steady-state-hypothesis.

You can switch between the two modes using the **Auto / Manual button** in the top right corner of the configuration dialog.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Manual Configuration

The manual configuration allows you to define the goal in terms of a **metric** and a **threshold**.  
It also lets you define a **color** for the goal, which will be used in the resulting Grafana dashboard to visualize the goal.
The dashboard will only highlight the goal if the metric is **above the threshold**.

### üìà Metric

A metric is a measurable value that can be used to evaluate the performance of your experiment.
Each metric can be assigned a **maximum** threshold value:

- ‚è≥ For time-based metrics assign the **maximum allowed response time** in **milliseconds** (e.g. `800`)
- üìä For percentage-based metrics assign the **maximum allowed percentage** (e.g. `95`)

Metrics are collected by [Gatling](https://gatling.io) and parsed by the MiSArch Experiment Tool, to be evaluated and displayed  in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/).
The following metrics are available:

| Metric                                               | Description                                                                                                     |

## ü™Ñ Auto Configuration

The MiSArch Experiment Tool provides an **automatic configuration** for the goals of your experiment.
It configures every metric you find above in the **Manual Configuration** section, based on the results of a **steady-state hypothesis** execution.

- üéØ The automatic configuration allows the system to automatically define goals in terms of a **steady-state hypothesis**.
- üìà Before running the experiment, your scenarios will be executed with a **constant user rate** for a configured **duration**.
- üõë After this execution the collected metrics will be used as the **thresholds for the goals**.
- üßÆ For time-based metrics you can define a **factor** to multiply the collected values with, to define a more relaxed goal.
- üî∫ All thresholds exceeded in the actual run will be displayed in the resulting Grafana dashboard in **red** color.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations:

- **Rate**: The constant user rate for the steady-state hypothesis execution in **users per second** (e.g. `10`).
- **Duration**: The duration of the steady-state hypothesis execution in seconds (e.g. `60`).
- **Factor**: The factor to multiply the collected values with for time-based metrics (e.g. `1.2`).

> üí° If you also configure a **warm-up phase**, the warm-up phase will be executed **before** the steady-state hypothesis phase.
